This folder contains the sbpl library. To use it follow the instructions from root directory of sbpl:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

Now the library is installed. To test it there are some environment configuration files in env_examples and in myenvfiles directories
(in both are subdivided for environment type and in the second folder also for number of orientation discretization)and there are
some motion primitives files in matlab/mprim and in myprimitives directories (in the second folder are subdivided by type).

Depending on which executable is launched there are different parameters to specify, but launching them with -h parameters an help appear.
Do not launch performance_test executable, it is only to do various sequential tests on planners and environments.
